<p style="font-family: serif;">My name is Clay Craig. I am a student at Millersville University and I am majoring in Technology and Engineering Education. I am from around the area just located in Conestoga Pennsylvania, which is about 15 to 20 minutes away from the school. I haven't had much involvemnt within the school year yet, if counting involvement as in clubs or other activities. The only things I have done so far are classes which I am so far enjoying. I am enjoying Millersville because of all the new people I have gotten to meet and all the friends I have gotten to make. I am going to try to get more involved within the next few years by joining some clubs like TEECA, Robotics, or Rock Climbing clubs. I've been out of school for two years since I graduated back in 2021, so im just trying to ease into things before I try to pack my schedule.<br><br> Overall the Millersville experience has been pretty good. The food at the dining halls is okay at the least. The campus is very enjoyable to see and they try to do different events during the weeks to try to get people more involved and to socialize more.<br><br> On this website you will find some of the projects that I worked on in my AENG 110 class. These were the projects that I enjoyed working on the most. For the most part I thought they were all really good for me and I will use the skills that I learned during these projects for other projects or tasks in the future during my career.</p>
